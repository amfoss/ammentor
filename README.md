Welcome to the **amMentor** ecosystem!  

aMentor is a mentorship management platform that transforms traditional mentoring into an engaging, gamified experience. Designed for structured learning environments such as college clubs, bootcamps, and online programs, it allows mentees to progress through curated learning tracks while being guided by experienced mentors.

The system emphasizes accountability, growth, and community engagement through features like task submissions, mentor approvals, interactive leaderboards, and achievement tracking. With support for role-based access, automated workflows, and multi-platform interaction, amMentor simplifies mentorship coordination and enhances the overall learning journey.

This page serves as the **meta hub**, linking all four independently maintained components:
